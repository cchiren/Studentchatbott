A simple project to track my online learning progress using structured data.  
Includes Coursera courses I’ve taken as part of my journey into cybersecurity, AI, and computer science.

## 🔍 Contents
- `coursera_courses.json` – A JSON list of online courses with details like course name, provider, and progress status.

## 💡 Why I Made This
While it’s a simple project, it helped me:
- Practice working with JSON
- Keep track of my learning goals
- Reflect on how far I’ve come

## 📌 Note
This was one of my earliest experiments with structured data.  
Feel free to explore — I’ve come a long way since then!
